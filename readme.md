# My Portfolio NPM

This is a project that serves as my portfolio website. It is built using the following technologies:

- Sass
- JavaScript
- HTML

## Scripts

The `package.json` file contains several scripts that can be used to automate tasks. The main 2 scripts we will be using are `npm run start` and `npm run build`.

### `npm run start`

This script runs all the watch scripts in parallel. It's used to start the development server and watch for changes in the Sass, JavaScript, and HTML files.


### `npm run build`

This script runs all the build scripts in sequence. It's used to build the website for production.
